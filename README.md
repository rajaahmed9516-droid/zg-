Files included:
- index.html
- Zubeen Garg.jpeg (the photo you uploaded)
- flower.png (generated placeholder)
- candle.png (generated placeholder)
- diya.png (generated placeholder)

To view locally:
1. Put all files in one folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser (double-click). The site will load locally.
3. To enable background music, add a file named 'song.mp3' in the same folder.

To host online (easy options):
1) GitHub Pages (free)
   - Create a GitHub account (if you don't have).
   - Create a new public repository (e.g., zubeen-tribute).
   - Upload all files.
   - Go to Settings -> Pages -> Select 'main' branch and '/ (root)' -> Save.
   - Your site will be live at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name> within a minute.

2) Netlify (drag & drop)
   - Create a free Netlify account.
   - Use 'Add new site' -> 'Deploy manually' -> Drag & drop the entire folder (or the index.html).
   - Netlify will give you a live link instantly.

If you want, I can:
- Prepare a version without autoplay audio (for mobile compatibility).
- Give exact step-by-step screenshots for GitHub Pages or Netlify.
